# Commands
How to read the commands lists:

- All Eco and Discord commands are case insensitive.
- [] indicates a command alias.
These are short forms of the command name and can be used to remove the need of preceding the command with /DiscordLink for Eco commands.
- () Indicates a parameter.
For Eco commands, the first parameter does not require a comma to separate it from the command name.
