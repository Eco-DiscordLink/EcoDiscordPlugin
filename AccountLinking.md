# Linking your Eco and Discord accounts
By linking your Eco and Discord accounts, you get access to more features like [Role Assignment](Modules.md#roles), [Watchers](Modules.md#watchers) and [Reaction Voting](Modules.md#elections).  

# Linking your account
1. Use [/DL LinkAccount \<UserName>](#Commands.md) in Eco.  
    The UserName parameter is your Discord account name (not nickname).  
    Example: /DL LinkAccount Monzun  
2. If your account could be found on the Discord server, the bot will send you a DM.  
3. Click the approve button on the message in your bot DMs to verify that you are the owner of both the Eco and Discord account.  
4. Your account is now linked!  

# Unlinking your account
If you no longer wish to have your account linked or you need to reset it for some reason, you can use the [/DL UnlinkAccount](#Commands.md) command to remove the account link.  

# Notes
* Your account link is only valid for one combination of Eco and Discord servers. If you join a new server, you will need to link your account on that server as well.  
* Your account link remains active over world resets. It is only removed if you use the [/DL UnlinkAccount](#Commands.md) command or if the server host deletes the persistent storage data.
