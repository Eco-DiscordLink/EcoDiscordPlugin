## Usage

### Eco <--> Discord Chat Synchronization
In order to synchronize the ingame chat with a Discord channel, you will need to set up a Discord bot and connect it to your Eco server via the DiscordLink config.
See [installation guide](Installation.md) for information on how to do this.

### Modules
DiscordLink offers a variety of modules that can show information and allow interaction with the game from Discord, such as player lists, election voting, existing laws and currencies.
See the [Modules Feature List](Modules.md) for more information.

### Commands
See the [command list](Commands.md) for available commands and how to use them.

### Notes:
1. **Emojis**  
When sending Emojis from Discord to Eco, bear in mind that these may either be removed or show up ingame as a â–¡ character.

2. **Discord Mentions**  
Make sure that `@` or `#` is not the first character in your message when writing Discord mentions.
Eco will consider them ingame mentions of players or channels and your message will open a chat channel ingame instead of being sent to the chat you intended and will therefore never get sent to Discord.

## Installation

See the [installation guide](Installation.md).

## Configuration

See this [configuration guide](ConfigurationGUI.md) for self hosted servers with access to the server GUI.
